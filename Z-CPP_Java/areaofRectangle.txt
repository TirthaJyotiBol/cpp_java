Q.program to find the area of the rectangle

Consstraints : 1<=L<=10^9
               1<=B<=10^9

Input Format  : 2 space seperated integer L and B
Output Format : single number which is the area of the rectangle

sample input  : 3 4
sample output : 12



/*                  NOTE:
 since range is from 1 to 10^9 thus for highest test case (10^9)*(10^9) =  10^(18) 
the range is greater than the int range,hense to convert it into long long int we use 1*LL
